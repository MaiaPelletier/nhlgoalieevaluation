Presentation feedback 
--------------------------------

(i.e. things to fix for the report)

- Slide 4: Should be 'per season'

- Slide 5: Map should be taller

- Slide 6: 
	- Colours are hard to distinguish. Might have been better to do age ranges (discrete scale). 
	- Jitter would help, cannot see if a pt is _one_ goalie or many overlapping

- Slide 4: Axes 5+e06 (no scientific notation)

- Slide 11: What do colours mean?

- Slide 13: Should have note about the end of the plots are unreliable due to small sample sizes in those years (no contracts)

- Slide 18: Would be nice to have statement about how only relevant variable is gs 
	- (hint: I would expect to see the model rerun with just gs & intercept in report)

- Slide 20: should mention using data includes bobrovsky to predict bobrovsky
