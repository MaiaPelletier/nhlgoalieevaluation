# Select numeric predictors
select_if(is.numeric)
```
## Predicting Salary
Feature selection
- *Way* too many predictors
```{r, echo = TRUE}
reg_data %>% ncol()
```
## Predicting Salary
Calculate **information gain** for predictors and grab 10 highest predictors in information gain
```{r, echo = FALSE}
## Feature selection
info_gain <- information.gain(formula = aav ~ ., data = reg_data)
subset_info_gain <- cutoff.k(info_gain, k = 10)
feat_selected <-
reg_data %>%
select(subset_info_gain, aav)
feat_selected %>% head()
```
## Predicting Salary
Build regression model with selected features
```{r linear model}
## Model
mod <- lm(aav~., feat_selected)
# Coefficient summary
mod %>%
tidy()
```
## Predicting Salary
Model evaluation
```{r mod eval}
# Full model summary
mod %>%
glance() %>%
select(1:6)
```
## Predicting Salary
Predictions
- Sergei Bobrovsky: got paid $11M AAV when he signed this season
```{r}
new_data1 <-
joined_data %>%
filter(player == 'sergei bobrovsky', szn == '18-19') %>%
select(subset_info_gain)
predict(mod, new_data1)
```
- Mikko Koskinen: got paid $4.5M AAV when he signed an extension
```{r}
new_data2 <-
joined_data %>%
filter(player == 'mikko koskinen') %>%
select(subset_info_gain)
predict(mod, new_data2)
```
## Findings
- Most of the goalies should probably get paid around $5 Million/year
- How much a goalie gets paid is not always an indicator of how good of a player they actually are
## Thank you
- Questions?
